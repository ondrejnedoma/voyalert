I am a high school student and my top priority for this app is for it to feel modern, snappy and easily usable, not to make millions from ads, in-app purchases or from making this a paid app like most big corporations would. In my opinion, donations are the least invasive form of monetization. If you like my work and can afford to donate, a donation would be greatly appreciated. The money received from these donations will be primarily used to keep the backend server running, pay for the yearly charge for a domain name and to cover any other expenses related to VoyAlert.
